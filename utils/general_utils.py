    Continuous learning rate decay function. Adapted from JaxNeRF

    """
    Builds a rotation matrix from a set of quaternion parameters.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 3, 3) representing the rotation matrices.

    This function first calculates the norm of each quaternion, and then normalizes the quaternions. 
    It then builds a rotation matrix using the normalized quaternions. 
    The rotation matrix is calculated using the following formula:

    R = [
        1 - 2 * (y^2 + z^2), 2 * (x * y - r * z), 2 * (x * z + r * y),
        2 * (x * y + r * z), 1 - 2 * (x^2 + z^2), 2 * (y * z - r * x),
        2 * (x * z - r * y), 2 * (y * z + r * x), 1 - 2 * (x^2 + y^2)
    ]

    where x, y, z, and r are the quaternion parameters, and N is the number of quaternions.

    The function assumes that the input tensor is on the GPU and uses torch.cuda for memory allocation.

    Note:
        The input tensor must be of type torch.float32.
